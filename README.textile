h2. Scweery

Ohai there! Thanks for coming to see _Scweery_. I am happy to have you here!

At this point in time Scweery is just a pup. It can only do a few simple tricks and will probably poop on your rug. But please feel free to play with it anyway. And "do let me know of any bad behaviour or new tricks you'd like to see":http://twitter.com/scweery  


h3. But what is it?

Easy. Scweery is a teeny weeny wrapper around JDBC that could be useful to you if you want to muck around with your database in SQL.

For instance, just say you want to manipulate some data in a table as a list of objects, you could do something like this:

<pre>
using(petsDB) { connection =>
  val findHogsQuery = "select name, gender from pets where family='erinaceidae' sort by cuteness" 
  val listOfHedgehogs = connection.make[Hedgehog](findHogsQuery) { row =>
    new Hedgehog(row.string("name"), row.string("gender"))
  }
}
</pre>

Scweery will take care of opening the connection, and closing it for you when you're done.

With all of your pet hedgehogs nicely lined up in a list, you'll probably want to:

<pre>
  listOfHedgehogs.foreach(_.hug)
</pre>

But that's your business.


h3. How do I build it?

You should use "Simple Build Tool":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/ - it is the most triumphant of build tools for cool scala projects. When you have it installed, go to the project base and create the _package_. Do you need a hint?

*sbt package*

How easy was that?


h3. How do I run it?

You don't run it. You use it.


h5. OK, how do I use it?

Make sure it's in your classpath and import it into your scala file (or the "REPL":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL) with:

<pre>
import scweery._
</pre>
