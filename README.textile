h2. Scweery

Ohai there! Thanks for coming to see _Scweery_. I am happy to have you here!


h3. But what is it?

Easy. Scweery is a teeny weeny wrapper around JDBC that could be useful to you if you want to muck around with your database in SQL.

For instance, just say you want to view a column in a table as a list of strings, you could do something like this:

<pre>
using(petsDB) { connection =>
  val findHogsQuery = "select name, gender from pets where family='erinaceidae' sort by cuteness" 
  val listOfHedgehogs = connection.make[Hedgehog](findHogsQuery) { row =>
    new Hedgehog(row.string("name"), row.string("gender"))
  }
}
</pre>

Scweery will take care of opening the connection, and closing it for you when you're done.

With all of your pet hedgehogs nicely lined up in a list, you'll probably want to:

<pre>
  listOfHedgehogs.foreach(_.hug)
</pre>

But that's your business.


h3. How do I build it?

You should use "Simple Build Tool":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/ - it is the most triumphant of build tools for cool scala projects. When you have it installed, go to the project base and create the _package_. Do you need a hint?

<pre>
jem@fawkes:~/projects/scweery$ sbt package [enter]
 ...
_[success] Build completed successfully._
</pre>

How easy was that?


h3. How do I run it?

You don't run it. You use it.


h4. OK, how do I use it?

Make sure it's in your classpath. Oh, and import it with:

<pre>
import scweery._
</pre>
